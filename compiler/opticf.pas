{
    Identical Code Folding (-OoICF)

    Ports the idea of gcc's -fipa-icf (gcc/ipa-icf.cc) and the gold linker's
    --icf to FPC, operating at the assembler-list level.

    After every routine of a module has been generated, its final instruction
    list lives back-to-back inside current_asmdata.asmlists[al_procedures],
    each routine bracketed by an ait_symbol (the mangled routine symbol) and its
    matching ait_symbol_end.  This pass walks that list, and for every foldable
    routine builds a *canonical* signature of its body:

      - the opcode, operand size and condition of each instruction;
      - every operand encoding (registers, immediates, memory references with
        their base/index/scale/segment/offset/refaddr);
      - references to symbols abstracted to the referenced symbol *name*, EXCEPT
        that references to the routine's own symbol(s) and its own local labels
        are rewritten to positional tokens (assigned in definition order).

    Two routines with equal canonical signatures emit byte-identical machine
    code (their bodies differ only in the routine's own symbol name and local
    label names, neither of which affects the emitted bytes -- only relocation
    *targets*, which the symbolisation has already proven structurally equal).
    Comparing the full canonical strings for equality IS the byte-verify step;
    the hashing is only used to bucket candidates cheaply.

    For each group of equal routines the first one encountered is kept intact
    (the "representative"); every later duplicate is collapsed into it, in one
    of two ways:

      1. jmp thunk (default): the duplicate's instruction body is replaced by a
         single `jmp <representative>`.  The duplicate keeps its own distinct
         symbol and therefore its own distinct address, so Pascal's @f<>@g
         semantics survive even when a folded routine's address is taken and
         compared.

      2. symbol alias (-OoICF, when provably safe): a *zero byte* fold -- the
         duplicate's entry symbol is emitted as an additional label at the
         representative's address (the same "two labels, one location" mechanism
         the code generator already uses for e.g. main/PASCALMAIN) and the
         duplicate's own body is dropped entirely.  This is only done when the
         duplicate's address can never be observed as a value, so that making
         @dup = @rep true is unobservable:
           - the duplicate symbol is unit-local (not global/exported/public):
             no other unit can take its address;
           - its address is never loaded as a value in this unit
             (tprocdef.icf_addrtaken, set by tloadnode.create_procvar);
           - it is a plain routine, not a virtual/external method (whose address
             leaks implicitly through a VMT / RTTI / method pointer).
         Anything failing these falls back to the address-preserving thunk.

    Cross-unit folding (shared PPU optimizer-summary mechanism):
      Each globally-visible routine that survives intra-unit folding stores a
      128-bit digest of its canonical body on its tprocdef (icf_hash), which
      symdef.write_optimizer_summary persists as the optsum_icf ppu tag, guarded
      by the target/ABI/-Cf instruction-set signature.  When a later unit is
      compiled, every used unit's summary is loaded and its survivors registered
      here (ICFRegisterExternalSurvivor, keyed by digest -> global mangled name).
      A routine of the unit being compiled whose canonical digest matches such a
      survivor -- and which found no intra-unit representative -- folds into a
      jmp thunk to that external global symbol.  Cross-unit duplicated generic
      specializations are the primary win.

      Collision stance: cross-unit we only carry the 128-bit digest, not the
      body, so (unlike the intra-unit pass, which byte-verifies via full-string
      compare) a cross-unit fold trusts digest equality alone.  The digest mixes
      the *entire* canonical instruction stream with two independent 64-bit
      avalanche hashes; for any realistic number of routines the birthday-bound
      collision probability (~n^2/2^128) is astronomically small, and a spurious
      match could only fold two routines whose full canonical streams collide
      under both mixers AND that were compiled for the identical target/ABI
      signature.  Cross-unit folds are therefore always thunks (never aliases):
      the survivor lives in another object, and a thunk keeps every duplicate's
      own address intact regardless of who takes it.

    Deliberately conservative -- correctness over coverage:
      - only routines whose body is straight-line instructions, labels, aligns,
        (extra) symbols and comments fold; anything with embedded constants,
        strings, cfi, unhandled operand kinds, etc. is skipped;
      - a routine only folds when it has enough instructions that the 5-byte
        thunk is a guaranteed net shrink.

    Opt-in via -OoICF; NOT part of the -O4 defaults.

      global so the linker can resolve cross-section references, yet an

          DUP's symbol and length = <DUP-end-label> - <DUP-symbol>.  After the move
          those two operands straddle two sections and the internal assembler raises
          IE 200404124 on the aranges length const (fantastica/fpc-torture seeds
